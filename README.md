# light-sdk
or: a tool for building Tools

## tl;dr
This repository contains the scaffolding for building simple tools for the Light Phone III. Included are a library ([:sdk:client](./sdk/client)) and placeholder application ([:tool](./tool)) that depends on it. To create a tool that is fully compatible with LightOS, you must write your application code within the `tool` module, using the primitives provided by the sdk client library.

You can and should use current Android best practices: Kotlin for all source code, Compose for UI, Coroutines for async programming, and MVVM architecture. **Although this is appears to be a fairly standard Android dev environment, you will quickly find out that we are (gently but broadly) restricting which Android APIs and third-party libraries can be used. This is in an effort to provide a secure and distinctly _light_ experience for our users. These restrictions are _not_ set in stone and should ease up over time. If there is a stable, open-source library that you'd like us to allow, please let us know! More on this later.**

## Quickstart
### Grabbing a token
We're currently hosting our library builds with GitHub Pacakges so each artifact can live beside its source. The tradeoff is that you'll need to add a GitHub token with package read access to your local build environment. **We are considering migrating to Maven Central to avoid this requirement when everything goes public.**
For now, you can either add environment variables with your username and token:
```
GITHUB_ACTOR=your_username
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token
```
or you can add them to your `local.properties` file:
```
gpr.user=your_username
gpr.key=your_token
```

### Running your Tool
**You can test your tool on any Android device or emulator**, but certain functionality (receiving push notifications, requesting special permissions) can only be tested with:
A) Real Light Phone hardware running LightOS
B) An Android emulator (on your computer) set up to run our LightOS emulator app as a _system app_ ([see advanced instructions](docs/system_app))

If you want to wait on those options, you can [create an emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds) that generally feels like an LP3:
* 1080 X 1240, 3.92" display
* Android API 34
* NO Google Play Services installed

### Start Building
1. Fork and/or clone this repository into your local dev environment.
2. Install Android Studio and open this project within it. (IntelliJ IDEA should also work)

3. Edit the code in `HomeScreen` and `HomeScreenViewModel` to get started. `Homescreen` surfaces a `@Composable` method named `Content`. This is the UI that is shown when the tool first boots. You'll notice this UI sources data from it's `viewModel` field, which is an instance of `HomeScreenViewModel`. Edit that class with your screen's logic and expose the data to the UI using either Compose `State` or Coroutine `Flow`s. If you want to create a new screen, create a new Screen/ViewModel pair: your screen should extend from `LightScreen` and your VM from `LightScreenViewModel`. Your screen implementation will need:
   1. A direct reference to your ViewModel's class type
   2. A factory method for creating a new instance of your ViewModel.

Look at `HomeScreen` as an example for how this is done. To navigate to your new screen, use the `navigateTo` function built into `LightScreen` - just pass it a lambda to create an instance of your new screen. Note that the `LightScreen` constructor takes in a `SealedLightActivity`. The lambda is provided an instance of this as a default parameter.

Since LightOS does not use Android system navigation, we provide a back button for you. As long as you use `navigateTo` to move between screens, our back button should work great. If need be, you can override the `onBackPressed` method in your `LightViewModel`.
